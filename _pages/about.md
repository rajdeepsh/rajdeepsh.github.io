I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), where my research focuses on the development of trustworthy and reliable `Artificial Intelligence` (AI).
Specifically, I investigate the testing of AI system implementations using `Software Engineering` (SE) techniques to ensure they operate as intended and can be trusted in real-world applications.

In addition to my research, I serve as a Graduate Tutor and teach Software Testing, which allows me to share my knowledge and passion for this field with students.
With a Masterâ€™s degree in Computing and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I have built a strong foundation in this dynamic area.
I believe that reliable AI has the potential to transform industries and enhance lives, and I am passionate about creating systems that not only perform effectively but also adhere to ethical standards.
I enjoy collaborating with others to turn innovative ideas into practical solutions, and I am excited to contribute to a future where AI is safe, transparent, and beneficial for everyone.
